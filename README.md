This repository provides a Google Colab notebook to easily run the **official implementation** of the **LGM (Large Multi-View Gaussian Model)**.

**â€» Disclaimer: This is an unofficial project and is not affiliated with the original authors or their research. The sole purpose of this repository is to make the original LGM code more accessible and easier to run for a wider audience.**
This allows you to experience the powerful 3D generation capabilities of the original LGM model with a single click, without the hassle of a complex local setup.

## ðŸš€ How to Use
1.  Click the **'Open in Colab'** badge above.
2.  Ensure the runtime type is set to **GPU** (`Runtime` > `Change runtime type`).
3.  Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the cells in order and execute the original LGM code.
